# do-while loops in Java

## Tasks
Create loops to achieve the following requirements:

* Print all multiples of 6 (6, 12, 18, ...) that are smaller than 50.  
* Count down from 10 (including 0).
* Print all each individual character of the String "Hello World!" in a new line (e.g. using charAt() ).

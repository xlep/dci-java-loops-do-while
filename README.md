# do-while loops in Java

## Tasks

### Basic loops
Create while loops to achieve the following requirements:

* Print the text "Hello World!" exactly 6 times.
* Start with the number 3 and double it. Double the result until it exceeds 100.
* Count down from 10 (include 0).

### Advanced Examples
* FizzBuzz: For each number between 1 and 20, print 'fizz' if the number is divisible by 3 and 'buzz' if the number is divisible by
  * Note: The modulo operator ( % ) will return the "remainder" of a division (https://www.baeldung.com/modulo-java)

* Print all perfect numbers between 1 and 500
  * Note: A perfect number is the sum of it's proper divisors e.g. 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number)
